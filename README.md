# Grønlund Webshop Repository

Welcome to the Grønlund Webshop Repository! This repository contains the codebase for the development of a new webshop for Grønlund, a physical antique store located in Frederiksberg. The existing webshop has several limitations, prompting the company to develop a completely new webshop with enhanced functionality and a new design that prioritizes a "mobile first" approach. This decision stems from the increasing number of visits to the website from mobile devices and tablets.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this webshop development project are as follows:

1. Create a new webshop with improved functionality and a modern design.
2. Prioritize mobile responsiveness to accommodate the growing number of visitors using mobile devices.
3. Facilitate the daily operations of the antique store, including monitoring new orders, processing and shipping paid orders, responding to inquiries, and adding newly acquired antiques to the webshop inventory for sale.
4. Enable the differentiation of orders originating from in-store sales versus online sales, as the current system lacks this capability.
5. Address the rising operational costs faced by the company, particularly regarding the viability of the physical store.
6. Implement logic in the webshop to help the store owner identify fast-selling products with high profitability. It should be accessible via mobile devices to assist the owner during product sourcing trips.

## Business Value

The development of this new webshop aims to provide the following business benefits to Grønlund:

1. Enhanced visibility and tracking of sales sources, enabling a better understanding of revenue streams.
2. Improved inventory management, offering a clearer picture of stock availability and facilitating efficient stock replenishment decisions.
3. Increased insights into the profitability of different products, allowing the store owner to optimize the product portfolio and focus on items with higher profit margins.
4. Time savings for the company by streamlining and automating various webshop-related tasks, enabling the team to allocate more time to crucial business activities.
